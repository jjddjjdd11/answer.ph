        <h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p> A woman was transporting an open box of cupcakes to a school party. The car in front of her stopped suddenly; she applied her brakes immediately. 
            <br> was wearing her seat belt and suffered no physical harm (just a great deal of embarrassment), but the cupcakes flew into the dashboard and became “smushcakes.” Explain what happened. <br> <a href="#answer">CLICK HERE TO SEE ANSWER</a>

        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p>Suppose two children push horizontally, but in exactly opposite directions, on a third child in a wagon. 
            <br> first child exerts a force of 75.0 N, the second exerts a force of 90.0 N, friction is 12.0 N, and the mass of the third child plus wagon is 23.0 kg.
            (a) Calculate the acceleration.
            <br>
             (b) What would the acceleration be if friction were 15.0 N? <a href="#answer">CLICK HERE TO SEE ANSWER</a>

Draw a free-body diagram of a diver who has entered the water, moved downward, and is acted on by an upward force due to the water which balances the weight (that is, the diver is suspended).

Show Solution
For a swimmer who has just jumped off a diving board, assume air resistance is negligible. The swimmer has a mass of 80.0 kg and jumps off a board 10.0 m above the water. Three seconds after entering the water, her downward motion is stopped. What average upward force did the water exert on her?
